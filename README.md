# Plex--Media-Scripts
This will be a collection of scripts that can be used with various programs to help with media management. 

increment.sh: A bash script where you can specify a directory and it will add 1 to the end of all filenames. This is useful for making sure episodes are matched correctly with Plex and Filebot. Note that files need to already be in the format of [filename][two digit episode number].[extension] for this to work.
